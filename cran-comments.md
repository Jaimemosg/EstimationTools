## v1.0.2 : Issues in submission 2:

* Please omit the field Mantainer: fixed
* This is way to vague: Thousands of R package do some parameter estimation: fixed
* The Description field should not start with the package name: fixed

## v1.0.1 : Issues in submission 1:

* Please omit that field as the (correctly spelled) Maintainer field will
  be auto generated from Authors@R anyway: fixed
* Please omit the file and the reference to the file as the GPL-3 is part
  of R anyway: fixed
* Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description 
  field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?: fixed
