\title{Extract Residuals from \code{maxlogL} model.}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{maxlogL}(object, parameter = NULL, type = "rqres", routine, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of \code{\link{maxlogL}} class obtained by fitting a
model with \code{\link{maxlogLreg}}.}

\item{parameter}{a character which specifies residuals for a specific parameter.}

\item{type}{a character with the type of residuals to be computed.
The default value is \code{type = "rqres"}, which is used to
compute the normalized randomized quantile residuals.}

\item{routine}{a character specifying the integration routine.
\code{integrate} and \code{gauss_quad} are available. Custom
routines can be defined but they must be compatible with the
\code{\link{integration}} API.}

\item{...}{further arguments for the integration routine.}
}
\value{
a vector with the specified residuals of a \code{maxlogLreg} model.

\code{residuals.maxlogL} is the \code{maxlogLreg} specific method for the
generic function residuals which extracts the residuals from a fitted model.
}
\details{
For \code{type = "deviance"}, the residuals are computed using the following
expression

\deqn{r^D_i = \mbox{sign}(y_i - \hat{\mu}_i) d_i^{1/2},}

where \eqn{d_i} is the residual deviance of each data point. In this context,
\eqn{\hat{\mu}} is the estimated mean, computed as the expected value using
the estimated parameters of a fitted \code{maxlogLreg} model.

On the other hand, for \code{type = "response"} the computation is simpler

\deqn{r^R_i = (y_i - \hat{\mu}_i).}
