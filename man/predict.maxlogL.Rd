\title{Predict Method for \code{maxlogL} Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{maxlogL}(
  object,
  parameter = NULL,
  newdata = NULL,
  type = c("link", "response", "terms"),
  se.fit = FALSE,
  terms = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of \code{\link{maxlogL}} class.}

\item{parameter}{a character which specifies the paramter to predict.}

\item{newdata}{a data frame with covariates with which to predict. It is an
optional argument, if omitted, the fitted linear predictors or
the (distribution) parameter predictions are used.}

\item{type}{a character with the type of prediction required. The default
(\code{type = "link"}) is on the scale of the linear predictors;
the alternative \code{type = "response"} is on the scale of the
distribution parameter.}

\item{se.fit}{logical switch indicating if standard errors of predictions
are required.}

\item{terms}{A character vector that specifies which terms are required if
\code{type = "terms"}. All terms are returned by default.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
If \code{se.fit = FALSE}, a vector of predictions is returned.
For \code{type = "terms"}, a matrix with a column per term and an attribute "constant"
is returned.

If \code{se.fit = TRUE}, a list with the following components is obtained:
\enumerate{
\item \code{fit}: Predictions.
\item \code{se.fit}: Estimated standard errors.
}
}
\description{
This function computes predictions and optionally the estimated standard errors
of those predictions from a model fitted with \code{maxlogLreg}.
}
\details{
This \code{summary} method computes and displays AIC, BIC,
estimates and standard errors from a estimated model stored i a \code{maxlogL}
class object. It  also displays and computes Z-score and p values of significance
test of parameters.
}
\note{
Variables are first looked for in newdata and then searched for in the usual way
(which will include the environment of the formula used in the fit). A warning
will be given if the variables found are not of the same length as those
in \code{newdata} if it is supplied.
