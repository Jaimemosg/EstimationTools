abstract = {A simplex method for finding a local minimum of a function of several variables has been devised by Nelder and Mead. For two variables, a simplex is a triangle, and the method is a pattern search that compares function values at the three vertices of a triangle. The worst vertex, where f (x, y) is largest, is rejected and replaced with a new vertex. A new triangle is formed and the search is continued. The process generates a sequence of triangles (which might have different shapes), for which the function values at the vertices get smaller and smaller. The size of the triangles is reduced and the coordinates of the minimum point are found. The algorithm is stated using the term simplex (a generalized triangle in N di-mensions) and will find the minimum of a function of N variables. It is effective and computationally compact. SEC. 8.2 NELDER-MEAD AND POWELL'S METHODS 431 Initial Triangle BGW Let f (x, y) be the function that is to be minimized. To start, we are given three vertices of a triangle: V k = (x k , y k), k = 1, 2, 3. The function f (x, y) is then evaluated at each of the three points: z k = f (x k , y k) for k = 1, 2, 3. The subscripts are then reordered so that z 1 ≤ z 2 ≤ z 3 . We use the notation (5) B = (x 1 , y 1), G = (x 2 , y 2), and W = (x 3 , y 3)},

GAMLSS allows all the parameters of the distribution of the response variable to be modelled as linear/non-linear or smooth functions of the explanatory variables. This paper starts by defining the statistical framework of GAMLSS, then describes the current implementation of GAMLSS in R and finally gives four different data examples to demonstrate how GAMLSS can be used for statistical modelling.},

abstract = {This book series reflects the recent rapid growth in the development and application of R, the programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is now widely used in academic research, education, and industry. It is constantly growing, with new versions of the core software released regularly and more than 10,000 packages available. It is difficult for the documentation to keep pace with the expansion of the software, and this vital book series provides a forum for the publication of books covering many aspects of the development and application of R. The scope of the series is wide, covering three main threads: • Applications of R to specific disciplines such as biology, epidemiology, genetics, engineering, finance, and the social sciences. • Using R for the study of topics of statistical methodology, such as linear and mixed modeling, time series, Bayesian methods, and missing data. • The development of R, including programming, building packages, and graphics. The books will appeal to programmers and developers of R software, as well as applied statisticians and data analysts in many fields. The books will feature detailed worked examples and R code fully integrated into the text, ensuring their usefulness to researchers, practitioners and students.},

These include the shapes of the density and hazard rate functions, the moments, skewness and kurtosis measures, the quantile function, and the limiting distributions of order statistics. Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters and their estimated asymptotic standard errors are derived. Three algorithms are proposed for generating random data from the proposed distribution. A simulation study is carried out to examine the bias and mean square error of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters as well as the coverage probability and the width of the confidence interval for each parameter. An application of the model to a real data set is presented finally and compared with the fit attained by some other well-known two-parameter distributions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the zero-truncated binomial distribution used in compounding is overdispersed. Some properties of the distribution are investigated.
