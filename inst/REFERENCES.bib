abstract = {A simulation study is presented where the Piecewise Exponential Estimator is compared with the Kaplan-Meier Estimator when the TTT-plot is used for identification of failure distribution models and also to determine the replacement time for a repairable system. We can conclude that the Piecewise Exponential Estimator seems to be better than the Kaplan-Meier Estimator, especially when we have heavy censoring and/or small sample sizes.},
